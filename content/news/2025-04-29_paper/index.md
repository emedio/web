Our paper on the catalytic mechanism and conformational dynamics of guinea pig l-asparaginase type 1 has just been published in ACS Catalysis!

<!--more-->

Our paper identifies the catalytic mechanism, key residues and the role of the electric field and loop dynamics of the substrate binding that guide rational enzyme engineering.
