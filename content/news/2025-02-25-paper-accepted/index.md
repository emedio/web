ðŸš€ Exciting news! Our latest research on the catalytic mechanism of GTP 
hydrolysis by RhoA has been accepted in ACS Catalysis! ðŸ§ªðŸ”¬ We reveal how 
glutamine tautomerism plays a crucial role in enzymatic activity. Check out the

This work provides a detailed computational investigation into the catalytic 
role of glutamine tautomerism in RhoA-mediated GTP hydrolysis, shedding light 
on fundamental enzymatic processes with broad implications for molecular 
biology and drug design. By combining quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics 
(QM/MM) simulations and advanced computational techniques, our findings offer 
new perspectives on how subtle electronic effects influence enzyme function.
