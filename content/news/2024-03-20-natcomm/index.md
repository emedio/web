​We are thrilled to announce our latest publication in Nature Communications! 
Our study uncovers the activation mechanisms and frictional forces governing 
enzymatic loop dynamics, providing new insights into protein function.

In collaboration with
[the group of Damien Laage from École Normale Supérieure (France)](https://www.chimie.ens.fr/recherche/laboratoire-pasteur/chimie-theorique/), 
we explore the activation and friction involved in enzymatic loop opening and 
closing dynamics. Our findings reveal that these processes are activated and 
controlled by torsional rearrangements around a single loop peptide group, 
accompanied by significant frictional forces. This research enhances our 
understanding of protein function and could inform future developments in 
enzymology.​
