Happy to share that our paper on pomotrelvir and nirmatrelvir binding and reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 main protease in

In this work, we studied the inhibition mechanism of pomotrelvir against SARS-CoV-2 main protease, using MM and QM/MM simulations and free energy calculations. Transforming pomotrelvir's groups to those in nirmatrelvir revealed that tertiary amines are favored at P2, while flexible side chains at this position may disrupt active site organization. These insights may aid in designing improved inhibitors for current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.
