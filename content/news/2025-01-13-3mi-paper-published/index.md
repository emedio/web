We are excited to announce the publication of our 
[latest work](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.4c02949) 
in The 
Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters: "Improved Description of Environment and 
Vibronic Effects with Electrostatically Embedded ML Potentials."

In collaboration with [Carles Curuthet from Universitat de Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/cplab/)
we introduce a multiscale strategy that combines electrostatically embedded 
machine learning potentials with the QM/MMPol polarizable embedding model. 
This approach accurately simulates optical spectra and excited state dynamics, 
as demonstrated on 3-methyl-indole in different environments. Our method paves
the way for deeper insights into the relationship between biological motions 
and photophysics.
