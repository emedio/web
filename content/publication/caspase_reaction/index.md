abstract: "Caspases are cysteine proteases in charge of breaking a peptide bond next to an aspartate residue. Caspases constitute an important family of enzymes involved in cell death and inflammatory processes. A plethora of diseases, including neurological and metabolic diseases and cancer, are associated with the poor regulation of caspase-mediated cell death and inflammation. Human caspase-1 in particular carries out the transformation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine pro-interleukin-1β into its active form, a key process in the inflammatory response and then in many diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Despite its importance, the reaction mechanism of caspases has remained elusive. The standard mechanistic proposal valid for other cysteine proteases and that involves the formation of an ion pair in the catalytic dyad is not supported by experimental evidence. Using a combination of classical and hybrid DFT/MM simulations, we propose a reaction mechanism for the human caspase-1 that explains experimental observations, including mutagenesis, kinetic, and structural data. In our mechanistic proposal, the catalytic cysteine, Cys285, is activated after a proton transfer to the amide group of the scissile peptide bond, a process facilitated by hydrogen-bond interactions with Ser339 and His237. The catalytic histidine does not directly participate in any proton transfer during the reaction. After formation of the acylenzyme intermediate, the deacylation step takes place through the activation of a water molecule by the terminal amino group of the peptide fragment formed during the acylation step. The overall activation free energy obtained from our DFT/MM simulations is in excellent agreement with the value derived from the experimental rate constant, 18.7 vs 17.9 kcal·mol–1, respectively. Simulations of the H237A mutant support our conclusions and agree with the reported reduced activity observed for this caspase-1 variant. We propose that this mechanism can explain the reactivity of all cysteine proteases belonging to the CD clan and that differences with respect to other clans could be related to the larger preference showed by enzymes of the CD clan for charged residues at position P1. This mechanism would avoid the free energy penalty associated with the formation of an ion pair. Finally, our structural description of the reaction process can be useful to assist in the design of inhibitors of caspase-1, a target in the treatment of several human diseases."
