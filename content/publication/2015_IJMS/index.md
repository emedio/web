abstract: "In this work, we studied Dihydroxyacetone (DHA) kinase from Citrobacter freundii, an enzyme that provides an efficient pathway for the preparation of DHA phosphate, a crucial C3 building block in nature. To modify the phosphoryl donor specificity of this enzyme from ATP to inorganic polyphosphate (poly-P), we initiated a directed evolution program. In the first cycle of evolution, the native enzyme was subjected to one round of error-prone PCR (EP-PCR) followed directly by DNA shuffling, without intermediate selection. Although the wild-type DHAK showed no activity with poly-P, screening revealed sixteen mutant clones with statistically significant activity using poly-P as the phosphoryl donor. The most active mutant featured a single mutation (Glu526Lys) located in a flexible loop near the active center. Through theoretical studies based on molecular dynamics simulations and hybrid Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) optimizations, we demonstrated that this mutation facilitates the binding of poly-P, positioning it more favorably in the active center for the reaction to occur."
