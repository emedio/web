abstract: "Here we present a modified version of the on-the-fly string method
  for the localization of the minimum free energy path in a space of arbitrary
  collective variables. In the proposed approach the shape of the biasing
  potential is controlled by only two force constants, defining the width of the
  potential along the string and orthogonal to it. The force constants and the
  distribution of the string nodes are optimized during the simulation,
  improving the convergence. The optimized parameters can be used for umbrella
  sampling with a path CV along the converged string as the reaction coordinate.
  We test the new method with three fundamentally different processes: chloride
  attack to chloromethane in bulk water, alanine dipeptide isomerization, and
  the enzymatic conversion of isochorismate to piruvate. In each case the same
  set of parameters resulted in a rapidly converging simulation and a precise
  estimation of the potential of mean force. Therefore, the default settings can
  be used for a wide range of processes, making the method essentially parameter
  free and more user-friendly."
