abstract: "Incorporation of environment and vibronic effects in simulations of optical
spectra and excited state dynamics is commonly done by combining molecular dynamics
with excited state calculations, which allows to estimate the spectral density
describing the frequency-dependent system-bath coupling strength. The need for efficient
sampling, however, usually leads to the adoption of classical force fields despite
well-known inaccuracies due to the mismatch with the excited state method. Here, we
present a multiscale strategy that overcomes this limitation by combining EMLE
simulations based on electrostatically embedded ML potentials with the QM/MMPol
polarizable embedding model to compute the excited states and spectral density of
3-methyl-indole, the chromophoric moiety of tryptophan that mediates a variety of important
biological functions, in the gas phase, in water solution, and in the human serum albumin
protein. Our protocol provides highly accurate results that faithfully reproduce their
ab initio QM/MM counterparts, thus paving the way for accurate investigations on
the interrelation between the time scales of biological motion and the
photophysics of tryptophan and other biosystems.
