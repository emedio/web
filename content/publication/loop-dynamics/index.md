abstract: "Protein loop dynamics have recently been recognized as central to enzymatic
activity, specificity and stability. However, the factors controlling loop opening and
closing kinetics have remained elusive. Here, we combine molecular dynamics
simulations with string-method determination of complex reaction coordinates to elucidate
the molecular mechanism and rate-limiting step for WPD-loop dynamics in the PTP1B
enzyme. While protein conformational dynamics is often represented as diffusive motion
hindered by solvent viscosity and internal friction, we demonstrate that loop opening
and closing is activated. It is governed by torsional rearrangement around a
single loop peptide group and by significant friction caused by backbone adjustments,
which can dynamically trap the loop. Considering both torsional barrier and
time-dependent friction, our calculated rate constants exhibit very good agreement with
experimental measurements, reproducing the change in loop opening kinetics between
proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our results to other
enzymatic loops, including the M20 DHFR loop, thereby offering prospects for loop
engineering potentially leading to enhanced designs.
