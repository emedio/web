summary: L-asparaginases catalyze the asparagine hydrolysis to aspartate. These
  enzymes play an important role in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia because these cells are unable to produce their own asparagine. Due
  to the immunogenic response and various side effects of enzymes of bacterial
  origin, many attempts have been made to replace these enzymes with mammalian
  enzymes such as human asparaginase type III (hASNaseIII). This study
  investigates the reaction mechanism of hASNaseIII through molecular dynamics
  simulations, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods, and free energy
  calculations. Our simulations reveal that the dimeric form of the enzyme plays
  a vital role in stabilizing the substrate in the active site, despite the
  active site residues coming from a single protomer. Protomerâ€“protomer
  interactions are essential to keep the enzyme in an active conformation. Our
  study of the reaction mechanism indicates that the self-cleavage process that
  generates an N-terminal residue (Thr168) is required to activate the enzyme.
  This residue acts as the nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbon of
  the substrate after a proton transfer from its hydroxyl group to the
  N-terminal amino group. The reaction mechanism proceeds with the formation of
  an acyl-enzyme complex and its hydrolysis, which turns out to be the
  rate-determining step. Our proposal of the enzymatic mechanism sheds light on
  the role of different active site residues and rationalizes the studies on
  mutations. The insights provided here about hASNaseIII activity could
  contribute to the comprehension of the disparities among different ASNases and
  might even guide the design of new variants with improved properties for acute
  lymphoblastic leukemia treatment.
