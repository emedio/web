Adrián graduated in Chemistry in June 2020 at the University of Murcia. His interest in theoretical chemistry led him to enroll in the Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modelling Master, which he completed in July 2022 at the University of Valencia. There he stayed and his current work focus on understanding the relation of chemical reactions and conformational changes in biological motors through molecular dynamics simulations and free energy methods.
