Iñaki Tuñón studied Chemistry in the University of Valencia. His PhD (1993) was devoted to the development and application of continuum models and was supervised by Prof. Estanislao Silla. His post-doctoral stay was in Nancy, working with Profs J. L. Rivail and M. F. Ruiz-López on DFT/MM Molecular Dynamics simulations. After the post-doc he returned to the Department of Physical Chemistry in Valencia where he got a permanent position in 2000. He currently leads the research unit on modeling chemical reactions in solution biological environments.
