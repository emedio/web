Carlos obtained his BSc in Chemistry at the "Universidad Nacional de Colombia" and his Msc in Chemistry at the "Universidad de los Andes" (Colombia). As undergraduate student he developed a huge interest in phytochemical procedures to find actives compounds against certains biological activities. But was only during his master studies that he fall in love with computational chemistry. Mainly because molecular docking allowed him to explore the activity of a large number of molecules against different targets and molecular dynamics helped him understand the behavior of these enzyme complexes. His works has been focused mainly to understand the inflammation processes related to Alzheimer’s disease as well as in the study of the reactivity of the principal protease of the SARS-CoV-2. Now he is studying the reaction mechanism of cysteine proteases related to Alzheimer’s disease and Covid-19 using QM/MM methodologies.
