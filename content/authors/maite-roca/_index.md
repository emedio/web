Maite Roca obtained her BsC(2000) and her European PhD(2005) in chemistry from Universitat Jaume I under the supervision of Vicent Moliner and Iñaki Tuñón. Her PhD was involved in the application of the hybrid QM/MM approach to the theoretical study of the mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme COMT. In 2006, she moved to the University of Southern California, Los Angeles (USA) to her postdoctoral research with the supervision of Prof. Arieh Warshel where her work was focused on the relationship of the thermal stability and the catalytic power of enzymes. Later she obtained a Juan de la Cierva contract at Universitat de Valencia and in 2012 she was contracted as researcher at Universitat Jaume I. Nowadays she has a tenure track position at Universitat de Valencia where she is studying the mechanism of DNA Methyltransferases and the role that dynamic effects play in enzyme catalysis.
