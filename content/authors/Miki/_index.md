Milorad obtained his BSc in Physical Chemistry from the University of Belgrade (Serbia) in 2019. He then pursued a Master’s degree in Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modelling at the University of Valencia, under the supervision of Prof. Iñaki Tuñón and Prof. José Javier Ruiz Pernía. His MSc thesis was awarded Best Master’s Thesis by the Territorial Section of Valencia of the Royal Spanish Society of Chemistry (RSEQ). He completed his PhD in Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Valencia in June 2025, supported by the “la Caixa” INPhINIT Retaining Fellowship. His research interests focus on the theoretical study of enzymatic catalysis, protein design and bridging theoretical chemistry methods and de novo enzyme design.
