Milorad obtained his BSc in Physical Chemistry at the University of Belgrade (Serbia) in 2019, with a special recognition from the Serbian Chemical Society for outstanding success. He then pursued a two-year master's programme in Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modelling at the University of Valencia, under the supervision of Prof. Iñaki Tuñón and Prof. José Javier Ruiz Pernía. His MSc thesis was awarded as the best thesis by the Territorial section of Valencia of the Royal Spanish Society of Chemistry (RSEQ). He finished his PhD studies in Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modelling at the University of Valencia in 2025, with the support of the "la Caixa" INPhINIT Retaining Fellowship, employing different methods of computational chemistry to study the reactivity of various types of L-asparaginases.
