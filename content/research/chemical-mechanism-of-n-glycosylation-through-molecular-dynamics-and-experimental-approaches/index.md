The project aims to unravel the chemical mechanism of N-glycosylation in oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, a crucial post-translational modification that influences protein folding, stability, and function.

<!--more-->

N-glycosylation is catalyzed by the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex which transfers an oligosaccharide to the asparagine residue in the N-X-S/T consensus sequon.  Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy methods we investigate how mutations in specific positions in the sequon influence OST binding and catalysis catalysis and thus N-glycosylation efficiency. This work is complemented by experimental approaches, including glycosylation assays in cell cultures with a model membrane protein to validate computational predictions. These findings hold potential for optimizing glycosylation processes in many biotechnology applications. This work is carried out in collaboration with Prof. Ismael Mingarro Mu√±oz (<https://www.uv.es/uvweb/universidad/es/ficha-persona-1285950309813.html?p2=mingarro&idA=>).
