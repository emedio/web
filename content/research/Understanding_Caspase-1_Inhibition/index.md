---title: "Understanding Function and Inhibition of the Enzyme Caspase-1 Through Molecular Dynamics Simulations"show_date: false---Caspase-1 plays a crucial role in inflammation and immune response, making it a key target in drug development for conditions such as autoimmune diseases and neuroinflammation. <!--more-->Our research has uncovered an unusual reaction mechanism for this cysteine protease, challenging the conventional view of its catalytic process. Using state-of-the-art QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations, we revealed that the catalytic histidine does not directly participate in proton transfer eventsï¿½resolving a long-standing experimental puzzle. These insights not only enhance our fundamental understanding of enzyme reactivity but also provide valuable guidance for the rational design of novel inhibitors.<!--more-->You can see the results of this work at [European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.02.064) and [ACS Catalysis](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.3c00037)
