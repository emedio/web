These enzymes catalyze the alkaline hydrolysis of phosphodiesters or monoesters.

Usually these enzymes also present a secondary activity catalyzing the hydrolysis of their non-natural substrates. A theoretical analysis is being carried out in order to understand how this family evolved from a common ancestror developing either diesterase or monoesterase activity.
